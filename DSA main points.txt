		=======>Arrays: saj
Advantages
1) contiguous memory
2) access time T(n)=O(1)
3) store same type of data using single variable

Disadvantages
1) insertion time complexity T(n) = O(n)
2) deletion time complecity T(n) = O(n)
3) size of array shoudl be known
4) wastage of memory as we declare 20 elements but we store jsut 3 elements.

Applications:
Searching
Sorting
Matrix Multiplication	//we use 2D array for image representation
Image processing
can implement sract, queue, graph and Tree

Practise:
CodeChef
HackerRank
